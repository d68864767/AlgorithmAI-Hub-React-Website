## Project Description

AlgorithmAI Hub React Website is a React-based website that provides a centralized hub for algorithms. It offers a user-friendly interface for discovering, understanding, and contributing to a wide range of algorithms across various domains. The website includes features such as an algorithm catalog, an interactive playground, educational resources, user profiles, and community collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Catalog**: Showcase a diverse catalog of algorithms, categorized by type and complexity.
- **Interactive Playground**: Provide an interactive environment for users to test and visualize algorithms.
- **Educational Resources**: Include documentation, tutorials, and educational content for each algorithm.
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles, track their progress, and contribute to the community.
- **Community Collaboration**: Enable users to discuss algorithms, share insights, and collaborate on projects.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key components:

- `/src`: React source code for the AlgorithmAI Hub website.
- `/components`: Reusable React components for building the user interface.
- `/pages`: Individual pages representing different sections of the website.
- `/graphql`: GraphQL queries and schema for retrieving algorithm data.
- `/styles`: Styling files using Styled Components.
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helper scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AlgorithmAI Hub React Website project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `/src` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
3. Set up your GraphQL server or API for algorithm data.
4. Configure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
5. Run the development server with `npm start` and start building!

## Usage Examples

Here is an example code snippet for querying algorithm data using GraphQL in React:

```javascript
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { GET_ALGORITHMS } from './graphql/queries';

const AlgorithmList = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_ALGORITHMS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  const algorithms = data.algorithms;

  // Render the algorithm list
  return (
    <ul>
      {algorithms.map((algorithm) => (
        <li key={algorithm.id}>{algorithm.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```
